However this is not a command (it might be one in the near future) Tasks give you the power to create Chisel tasks.
Just create an class in the chisel root dir, (or any folder inside the Chisel root dir). And register the task in the chiselTasks file.

Non registered functions will be ignored, so if you want to use your function you'd better register it.

The functions are called on __construct, Yes we know its not the best way to do things, but for Chisel it works great, from the __construct function
you can load up your entire class, and its parameters

		/===========================/

		/===========================/

Just use the default file, or the code given below:

*note : The class and the file name should be the same
*note : Yes there is an CLI beautyfire comming in the function parameters (this is CLImate, you should check it out) it's callable by $this->cli->red('you output'); // or all the other features it offers
*note : The class has to be registered in the app\chisel namespace, else yes try it it won't work.


<?php

namespace app\chisel;


class chiselYourClassName{

	private $cli;
	private $args;

	public function __construct($argv,$cli = false){
		$this->cli = $cli;
		$this->args = $argv;
	}


}
